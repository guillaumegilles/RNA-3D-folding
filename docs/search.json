    "text": "Slightly more than a year ago, Kaggle set out to solve one of the biggest challenges remaining in biology, with Ribonanza RNA Folding challenge. The goal was to create a model to predict the structure of any RNA molecule and its resulting chemical mapping profile. A foundation model emerged rom this competiton, distilled from Kagglers’ top models: RibonanzaNet.\nUnfortunately, predict RNA 3D structures are still a difficult computational task. Deep learning breakthroughs like AlphaFold have transformed protein structure prediction, but progress with RNA has been much slower due to limited data and evaluation methods.\nThe goal of a new Kaggle competition, Stanford RNA 3D Folding, is to achieve an automated RNA 3D structure prediction method that can outperform human experts.",
